# Deep-ML-solutions

This repository contains my solutions to algorithmic and coding challenges from the [Deep-ML](https://deep-ml.com) platform. 
The exercises span a wide range of machine learning topics, including core algorithms, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and linear algebra.

All solutions are implemented in Python, mostly using only NumPy and standard libraries unless otherwise required.

## 🌐 Topics Covered

The project is organized into the following folders:
···
Deep-ML/
├── Computer_Vision/ # Image processing, kernels, convolution
├── Deep_Learning/ # Activation functions, forward/backpropagation
├── Linear_Algebra/ # Matrix operations, vector transformations
├── Machine_Learning/ # Regression, classification, evaluation metrics
├── NLP/ # Bag-of-words, TF-IDF, tokenization
├── easy/, medium/, hard/  # Problems grouped by difficulty (from Deep-ML)
···

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy

## 🚀 How to Run
Each `.py` file is independently runnable.

⚠️ Note: These solutions are based on my personal learning efforts on Deep-ML. They are not official answers from the platform.
